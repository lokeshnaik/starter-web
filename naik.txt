what goes around comes around that is what karma teaches.
Karma is a boomrang.No one can escape from karma.
Only time matter for that to arrive.
so always do good to others no matter what they do you,even if they 
harm you and betry you just keep going and believe that karma will take its actions.
I should work harder and with dedication.
